    <p>The color you see is only the color you think you see. Your interpretation of light landing on a surface
      depends on your frame of reference and your frame of mind—both can be altered at the speed of light.When I’m
      overwhelmed in a crowd I distract myself by looking for as many red-colored objects as I can. Red is not
      typically a calming color, especially if you’re staring at miles of brake lights in traffic, but it’s really
      easy for me to see. Red becomes the most dominant thing on my mind.
    </p>

    <p1 class="topic">“Someone who speaks of the character of a color is always thinking of just one particular way it is used.”
      — Ludwig Wittgenstein
    </p1>

    <p>Humans have used red since the neolithic era, as seen in the prehistoric cave drawings; When developing
      languages, red is typically the color named first after black and white. It’s now used so frequently in
      advertising—because it attracts the most attention—that people have learned to ignore it. The ad industry has
      successfully made a highly visible color…invisible.
    </p>
    <p>In grade school, I learned that yellow was the most soothing to color with when I brought the expensive markers
      I wasn’t allowed to use at home to school. I colored in a picture of Paddington wearing a raincoat well enough
      for my teacher to hang it on the wall for parent-teacher day. The comfort I experienced from quietly meeting the
      black lines with a high-contrast yellow, disappeared as I waited for my mother to find me out.
    </p>

    <p1 >In her piece commemorating a decade of internet colors, designer Laurel Schwulst reflects that “<span id="yellow">yellow</span> tries
      to show you the way” in Google Maps.
    </p1>


    <p>Colors can be hard to see. To the chemist John Dalton, red, orange, yellow, and green all appeared the same.
      The rest of the color spectrum appeared as gradients of blue and purple. Dalton went on to write the first
      scientific paper on the subject of color blindness, “Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours” in
      1798.
    </p>
    <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein — the Austrian philosopher who popularized the rabbit-duck illusion as a means of
      describing two different ways of seeing — wrote in Remarks on Colour, that “not every deviation from the norm
      must be a blindness.” He pointed out that the “normal” sighted and the color-blind do not have the same concept
      of color-blindness.
    </p>
    <p>People with decreased ability to differentiate between hues experience color through a series of judgments. My
      colleague, for example, explained that for red, green, and brown to function for him, he has to consider their
      context. These judgments may be “wrong” when they need to be “right”; Like the order of a traffic light, the
      alternating red and green battery light on a vape pen, or the order of a color legend matching the clockwise
      color placement in a pie chart.
    </p>

    <p1 >“If one says <span class="red">‘red’</span>and there are fifty people listening, it can be expected that there will be <span class="red">fifty reds</span> in
      their minds,” wrote the artist and educator Josef Albers. We see fifty different reds because we each perceive
      and experience color differently.
    </p1>

    <p>The artist Wassily Kandinsky could practically hear and taste color because of his synesthesia. To him yellow
      was a trumpet’s C note, black was the end of things, “blue is cold, red is a square, and green is a feeling,” as
      summarized by the painter Amy Sillman who called Kandinsky’s philosophy a kind of color astrology in her essay
      “Drug, Poison, Remedy, Talisman, Cosmetic, Intoxicant.”
    </p>
    <p> In 1810, writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe decided that an equilateral triangle was the most effective form
      for his ideas on the psychological effect of colors. This new way of organizing color came about a hundred years
      after Sir Isaac Newton first arranged colors on a disk, to create an early form of the color wheel. The triangle
      served Goethe as a modular system of desirable and dissonant color relationships that evoked vibes like serious,
      mighty, serene, and melancholic.
    </p>
    <p>Colors can change depending on the nature of surfaces, like the atmospheric oxidation of the Statue of
      Liberty’s plating from shiny copper to verdigris (a bluish-green patina). In 1906, the Army Corps of Engineers
      vetoed a proposal from the United States Congress to restore the statue, concluding that the patina protecting
      the underlying metal from corrosion “softened the outlines, and made it beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>We can see those softened outlines because light helps us discern forms. I find Vantablack—one of the darkest
      known substances, absorbing 99.96% of visible light—unsettling.
    </p>

    <p1 >As Kassia St Clair explains in The Secret Lives of Color, “black is an expression of light, in this case, it’s
      absence.” My eyes hunt for the surface, and Vantablack leaves nothing to see.
    </p1>

    <p> White surfaces reflect and scatter visible light, and according to Wittgenstein “very few people have seen
      pure white.” In the essay “In Praise of Shadows” on traditional Japanese aesthetics, Jun’ichirō Tanizaki wrote
      that “western paper turns away light, while [Japanese] paper seems to take it in, to envelope it gently, like
      the soft surface of a first snowfall.” If you take a piece of computer paper, that you know is white in its
      normal surroundings, and place it next to snow, the paper may appear grey. A white can be light grey in poor
      lighting or a light grey in good lighting.
    </p>
    <p>Or a dress can look black and blue under yellow light and white and gold in blue light. In full sunlight, the
      petals of a red flower appear bright red against duller green leaves. At dusk, the red flowers become darker
      while blue flowers appear brighter than they did in full daylight. This effect is called the Purkinje shift.
    </p>
    <p>Albers based his career on studying these kinds of shifts in color. In his book Interaction of Color, first
      published in 1963, he created color theory exercises that could make “colors lie”—as Tamara Shopsin put it in
      her essay “Homage to an Homage of an Homage.” By itself, a color appears dominant, but when placed next to an
      even stronger hue, we can see its more diminished true nature.
    </p>

    <p1 class="topic">Reflection</p1>

    <p>Courtney takes us through an exciting journey of understanding the history of color, how colors are perceived,
      experienced, how they evoke different sensibilities, how they blend in, stand out, and express themselves
      through the medium of light. We are introduced to numerous references from books on color, one specific quote
      that I loved was from “The Secret Lives of Color” which states that “black is an expression of light, in this
      case, it’s absence.” The seemingly contradicting sentence, makes perfect sense highlighting how every color is a
      result of the reflection of light, even the color black. “The Chromatic Diet” by artist Sophie Calle talks about
      eating foods of a specific color. These references used throughout make the passage an interesting read.
    </p>
    <p>Color, is at the heart of how we perceive things, and as designers we need to be mindful of how these colours
      have been expressed throughout history. The article instills a sense of enquiry to dive deep into the world of
      color and it’s varied associations.
